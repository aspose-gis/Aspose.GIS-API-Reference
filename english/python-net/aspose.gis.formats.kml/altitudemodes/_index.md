**Module:** [aspose.gis.formats.kml](/psd/python-net/aspose.gis.formats.kml/)

**Full Name:** aspose.gis.formats.kml.AltitudeModes

**Aspose.PSD Version:** 24.12.0

## **Members**
| **Member name** | **Description** |
| :- | :- |
| ABSOLUTE | Interprets the altitude as a value in meters above sea level. |
| CLAMP_TO_GROUND | For a camera, this setting also places the camera relativeToGround, <br/>            since putting the camera exactly at terrain height would mean that <br/>            the eye would intersect the terrain (and the view would be blocked). |
| NONE | Without altitude mode. |
| RELATIVE_TO_GROUND | Interprets the altitude as a value in meters above the ground. |
