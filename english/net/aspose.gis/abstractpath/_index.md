## AbstractPath class

An `AbstractPath` is a base class for classes that specify a unique location in an environment similar to a filesystem, like a local filesystem, a remote file storage or a ZIP archive, among others.

```csharp
public abstract class AbstractPath
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract [Location](location) { get; } | Gets a string representation of the location of this `AbstractPath`. |
| abstract [Separator](separator) { get; } | Gets a separator character used to separate directory levels of the [`Location`](./location) string. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [FromLocalPath](fromlocalpath)(string) | Creates an [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath) that represents a location on the local filesystem. |
| static [FromStream](fromstream)(Stream) | Creates an [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath) from a Stream. |
| virtual [Combine](combine)(string) | Combines this [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath) with specified path components. |
| abstract [Delete](delete)() | Deletes a file pointed to by this path. |
| [GetExtension](getextension)() | Returns the extension of this [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath). |
| [GetFileName](getfilename)() | Returns the file name and extension of this [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath). |
| [GetFileNameWithoutExtension](getfilenamewithoutextension)() | Returns the file name of this [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath) without the extension. |
| abstract [IsFile](isfile)() | Gets a value indicating whether this path points to an existing file that can be opened for reading. |
| abstract [ListDirectory](listdirectory)() | Returns paths located inside this `AbstractPath`, if it's a directory. |
| abstract [Open](open)(FileAccess) | Opens this `AbstractPath` as a file. |
| virtual [WithExtension](withextension)(string) | Returns a new [`AbstractPath`](../abstractpath) with the file extension changed to the specified value. |

### Remarks

An `AbstractPath` might specify a location on a local filesystem, a location on a remote filesystem or an external storage like the Azure Blob storage, and so on. The location might point to an existing or not existing file-like objects, directory-like objects, or have any other meaning reasonable for the environment it belongs to. As an example, an `AbstractPath` inheritor that represents a location on the local filesystem can point to an existing file, directory, or to a place in the filesystem that has not been created yet. In order to make a new filesystem-like storage available to `Aspose.GIS`, one should inherit this class and implement its abstract methods.
