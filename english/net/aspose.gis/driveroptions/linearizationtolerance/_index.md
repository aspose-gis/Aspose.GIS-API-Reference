## DriverOptions.LinearizationTolerance property

A tolerance to use to linearize curve geometries.

```csharp
public double LinearizationTolerance { get; set; }
```

## Property Value

The tolerance to pass to [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/tolineargeometry) before adding geometries.

### Remarks

This is a creation options - it does not affect opening. If driver does not support non-linear geometries they are automatically linearized. This property specifies an argument to the [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/tolineargeometry) method that is used for linearization.
