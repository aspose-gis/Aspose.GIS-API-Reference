## Extent.Contains method (1 of 3)

Determines whether this extent contains a coordinate defined by the arguments.

```csharp
public bool Contains(double x, double y)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x | Double | X of the coordinate. |
| y | Double | Y of the coordinate. |

### Return Value

Value, indicating whether coordinate is inside bounding box.

### Remarks

Coordinates located on the bounds of this [`Extent`](../../extent) are considered to be contained by this [`Extent`](../../extent).

### See Also

* class [Extent](../../extent)
* namespace [Aspose.Gis](../../extent)
* assembly [Aspose.GIS](../../../)

## Extent.Contains method (2 of 3)

Determines whether this extent contains the argument.

```csharp
public bool Contains(Extent extent)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| extent | Extent | Another extent. |

### Return Value

Value, indicating whether this extent contains the argument.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of this extent and the argument are both not `null` and not equal to each other. |

### Remarks

Coordinates located on the bounds of this [`Extent`](../../extent) are considered to be contained by this [`Extent`](../../extent). For this reason, equal extents are considered to contain each other.

* namespace [Aspose.Gis](../../extent)

## Extent.Contains method (3 of 3)

Determines whether this extent contains the argument.

```csharp
public bool Contains(IGeometry geometry)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| geometry | IGeometry | A geometry to test for containment. |

### Return Value

Value, indicating whether this extent contains the argument.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of this extent and the argument are both not `null` and not equal to each other. |

### Remarks

Coordinates located on the bounds of this [`Extent`](../../extent) are considered to be contained by this [`Extent`](../../extent).
