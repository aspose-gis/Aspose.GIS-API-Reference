## SimpleLabeling.FeatureBasedConfiguration property

A callback that is used to configure this labeling before handling a feature.

```csharp
public Action<Feature, SimpleLabeling> FeatureBasedConfiguration { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

This callback is invoked before labeling every feature. It accepts a feature that is about to be labeled and a clone of this labeling. By changing properties of the clone, it is possible to update labeling's behavior based on feature's attributes.
