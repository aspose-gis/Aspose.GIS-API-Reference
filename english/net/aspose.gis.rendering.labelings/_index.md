`Aspose.Gis.Rendering.Labelings` namespace provides classes for configuring vector features labeling.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Labeling](./labeling) | The abstract root class for labelings, classes that describe how to place labels on features. |
| [LabelingRule](./labelingrule) | A user-defined rule for [`RuleBasedLabeling`](../aspose.gis.rendering.labelings/rulebasedlabeling). |
| [LabelPlacement](./labelplacement) | Label placement specifies how labels are placed relatively to feature's geometry. |
| [LineLabelPlacement](./linelabelplacement) | Line label placement places labels along line. |
| [NullLabeling](./nulllabeling) | The [`NullLabeling`](../aspose.gis.rendering.labelings/nulllabeling) skips labeling of a geometry it is applied to. |
| [PointLabelPlacement](./pointlabelplacement) | Points label placement places labels near geometries centers. |
| [RuleBasedLabeling](./rulebasedlabeling) | Applies a labeling to feature according to user-defined rules. |
| [SimpleLabeling](./simplelabeling) | A simple labeling places label on every feature. |
## Enumeration

| Enumeration | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [FontStyle](./fontstyle) | Specifies style to be applied to text. |
| [LineLabelAlignment](./linelabelalignment) | Specifies how the label is aligned with the line. |
| [MultipartMode](./multipartmode) | Specifies how labels are rendered for features that contain multipart geometries. |
