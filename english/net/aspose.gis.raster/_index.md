`Aspose.Gis.Raster` namespace provides classes for working with raster formats.

## Classes

| Class | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [RasterBand](./rasterband/) | Contains data about a raster Band. |
| [RasterCellSize](./rastercellsize/) | Describes the size, scale and rotation of a raster cell on a map. |
| [RasterLayer](./rasterlayer/) | Represents a raster layer. |
| [RasterReadExpression](./rasterreadexpression/) | Represents a delegate, which is reading expression. |
| [RasterRect](./rasterrect/) | Block of raster cells. |
| [RasterStatistics](./rasterstatistics/) | The statistics for any raster layer. |
| [WarpOptions](./warpoptions/) | Options for raster warping. |
## Structures

| Structure | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [RasterExpressionContext](./rasterexpressioncontext/) | This class describes the value context when it reads raster a band. |
## Interfaces

| Interface | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [IRasterBand](./irasterband/) | Contains metadata about a raster band. |
| [IRasterCellSize](./irastercellsize/) | Describes the size, scale and rotation of a raster cell on a map. |
| [IRasterValues](./irastervalues/) | Provides access to the values of raster bands. |
## Enumeration
