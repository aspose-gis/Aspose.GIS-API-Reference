## WarpOptions.Height property

Specifies output raster height in pixels and columns. If the value is set to 0, the height is automatically computed. The default value is "0".

```csharp
public int Height { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

If the height is set to 0, the value will be taken from the original height or computed from [`CellHeight`](../cellheight). Note that `Height` cannot be used with [`CellHeight`](../cellheight).
