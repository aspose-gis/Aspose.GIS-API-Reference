## GmlOptions.LoadSchemasFromInternet property

Determines whether Aspose.GIS is allowed to load XML schema from Internet. If set to `false`, schemas with absolute URIs that does not start with 'file://' would not be loaded. Default is `false`.

```csharp
public bool LoadSchemasFromInternet { get; set; }
```

### Remarks

Aspose.GIS uses XML schema of GML file in order to create [`FeatureAttributeCollection`](../../../aspose.gis/featureattributecollection). XML schema files can be distributed alongside with GML files or can be located on the Internet. In former case, you need to set this option to `true` to allow Aspose.GIS to load XML schema.
