## SpatialReferenceSystemType enumeration

Represents type of spatial reference system.

```csharp
public enum SpatialReferenceSystemType
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Unknown | `0` | Default value. Can be returned from [`Type`](../spatialreferencesystem/type) if this is a compound SRS with invalid combination of underlying SRSs. See [`IsCompound`](../spatialreferencesystem/iscompound). |
| Geographic | `1` | Geographic SRS is based on angular longitude and angular latitude. Geographic SRS can be converted to [`GeographicSpatialReferenceSystem`](../geographicspatialreferencesystem) via [`AsGeographic`](../spatialreferencesystem/asgeographic) method. |
| Geocentric | `2` | Geocentric SRS is three dimensional cartesian SRS with origin at Earth center. Geocentric SRS can be converted to [`GeocentricSpatialReferenceSystem`](../geocentricspatialreferencesystem) via [`AsGeocentric`](../spatialreferencesystem/asgeocentric) method. |
| Projected | `3` | Projected SRS is based on linear X and linear Y. It is the result of application a projection on a Geographic SRS. Projected SRS can be converted to [`ProjectedSpatialReferenceSystem`](../projectedspatialreferencesystem) via [`AsProjected`](../spatialreferencesystem/asprojected) method. |
| Vertical | `4` | Vertical SRS describes linear height coordinate. Vertical SRS can be converted to [`VerticalSpatialReferenceSystem`](../verticalspatialreferencesystem) via [`AsVertical`](../spatialreferencesystem/asvertical) method. |
| Local | `5` | Local SRS relates coordinates to some object, other them Earth. Local SRS can be converted to [`LocalSpatialReferenceSystem`](../localspatialreferencesystem) via [`AsLocal`](../spatialreferencesystem/aslocal) method. |
