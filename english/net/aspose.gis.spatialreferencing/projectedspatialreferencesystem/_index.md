## ProjectedSpatialReferenceSystem class

Projected SRS is a result of application a projection to geographic SRS. A projected SRS can be two dimensional or three dimensional. If projected SRS is three dimensional, then it is actually a compound SRS of two dimensional projected SRS and one dimensional vertical SRS.

```csharp
public abstract class ProjectedSpatialReferenceSystem : SpatialReferenceSystem
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract [AngularUnit](angularunit) { get; } | Unit, that is used for angular values in this SRS and for angular parameters of [`Projection`](./projection). Matches angular unit of [`Base`](./base). |
| [AsProjected](asprojected) { get; } | Return this. |
| abstract [AxisesOrder](axisesorder) { get; } | Order of axises in this SRS. If this SRS is not valid and has wrong axises directions, Invalid is returned. |
| abstract [Base](base) { get; } | Geographic SRS to which [`Projection`](./projection) was applied to get this SRS. |
| abstract [DimensionsCount](dimensionscount) { get; } | Returns dimensions count in this SRS. For projected SRS this can be: two - if this is single projected SRS. three - if this is compound SRS, which consists of single, two dimensional, projected SRS and vertical SRS, that adds third dimension. |
| [HasGeographicDatum](hasgeographicdatum) { get; } | Returns true, since projected SRS always have prime meridian. |
| [HasPrimeMeridian](hasprimemeridian) { get; } | Returns true, since projected SRS always have prime meridian. |
| abstract [LinearUnit](linearunit) { get; } | Unit, that is used for linear dimensions in this SRS and for linear parameters of [`Projection`](./projection). |
| abstract [Projection](projection) { get; } | Projection, that was applied to [`Base`](./base) to get this SRS. |
| [Type](type) { get; } | Returns Projected. |
