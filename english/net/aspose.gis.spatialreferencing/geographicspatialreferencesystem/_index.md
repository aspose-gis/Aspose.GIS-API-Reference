## GeographicSpatialReferenceSystem class

A Geographic SRS is an SRS that is based on longitude and latitude. A Geographic SRS can be two dimensional or three dimensional. If geographic SRS is three dimensional, then it is actually a compound SRS of two dimensional SRS and vertical SRS.

```csharp
public abstract class GeographicSpatialReferenceSystem : SpatialReferenceSystem
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract [AngularUnit](angularunit) { get; } | Unit, used for angular dimensions, in this SRS. |
| [AsGeographic](asgeographic) { get; } | Returns this. |
| abstract [AxisesOrder](axisesorder) { get; } | Order of axises in this SRS. If this SRS is not valid and has wrong axises directions, Invalid is returned. |
| abstract [DimensionsCount](dimensionscount) { get; } | Returns dimensions count in this SRS. For geographic SRS this can be: two - if this is single geographic SRS. three - if this is compound SRS, which consists of single, two dimensional, geographic SRS and vertical SRS, that adds third dimension. |
| [HasGeographicDatum](hasgeographicdatum) { get; } | Returns `true`, since geographic SRS always have prime meridian. |
| [HasPrimeMeridian](hasprimemeridian) { get; } | Returns `true`, since geographic SRS always have prime meridian. |
| [Type](type) { get; } | Returns Geographic. |
