## CompoundSpatialReferenceSystem class

Compound SRS unites two underlying SRS, none of which can be compound.

```csharp
public class CompoundSpatialReferenceSystem : SpatialReferenceSystem
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [AsCompound](ascompound) { get; } | Return this. |
| override [AsGeographic](asgeographic) { get; } | Return geographic representation of this SRS. If this compound SRS indeed represents a geographic SRS, the result will be three dimensional geographic SRS (with longitude, latitude, height dimensions). Otherwise an exception will be thrown. |
| override [AsProjected](asprojected) { get; } | Return projected representation of this SRS. If this compound SRS indeed represents a projected SRS, the result will be three dimensional projected SRS (with X, Y, height dimensions). Otherwise an exception will be thrown. |
| override [DimensionsCount](dimensionscount) { get; } | Number of dimensions. For compound SRS this is sum of number of dimensions of underlying SRS. |
| override [GeographicDatum](geographicdatum) { get; } | Return geographic datum of this SRS. If both [`Head`](./head) and [`Tail`](./tail) have geographic datum - return geographic datum of head. |
| override [HasGeographicDatum](hasgeographicdatum) { get; } | Compound SRS have geographic datum if any of underlying SRS have geographic datum. |
| override [HasPrimeMeridian](hasprimemeridian) { get; } | Compound SRS has prime meridian if any of underlying SRS have prime meridian. |
| [Head](head) { get; } | First underlying SRS. |
| override [IsCompound](iscompound) { get; } | Returns `true`. |
| override [PrimeMeridian](primemeridian) { get; } | Return prime meridian of this SRS. If both [`Head`](./head) and [`Tail`](./tail) have prime meridian - return prime meridian of head. |
| [Tail](tail) { get; } | Second underlying SRS. |
| override [Type](type) { get; } | Type of this Compound SRS. Can be Geographic if this Compound SRS is combination of geographic and vertical SRS, or Projected if this Compound SRS is combination of projected and vertical SRS. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| override [GetAxis](getaxis)(int) | Get [`Axis`](../axis) that describes dimension. |
| override [GetUnit](getunit)(int) | Get [`Unit`](../unit) of dimension. |
| override [IsEquivalent](isequivalent)(SpatialReferenceSystem) | Detects whether this SRS is equivalent to other SRS. . |
| override [Validate](validate)(out string) | Determine if this SRS is valid. See [`Validate`](../spatialreferencesystem/validate) for validity description. |
