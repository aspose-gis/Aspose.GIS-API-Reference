## Geometry.FromBinary method (1 of 2)

Creates a geometry from its Well-Known Binary representation.

```csharp
public static IGeometry FromBinary(byte[] wkb)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wkb | Byte[] | Well-Known Binary representation of a geometry. |

## Return Value

A geometry represented by the argument.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is null. |
| NotSupportedException | Argument represents a geometry of not supported type. |
| FormatException | Argument is not a valid Well-Known Binary. |

## Geometry.FromBinary method (2 of 2)

Creates a geometry from its Well-Known Binary representation.

```csharp
public static IGeometry FromBinary(byte[] wkb, SpatialReferenceSystem spatialReferenceSystem)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wkb | Byte[] | Well-Known Binary representation of a geometry. |
| spatialReferenceSystem | SpatialReferenceSystem | Spatial Reference System to be assigned to the geometry. |

## Return Value

A geometry represented by the argument.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is null. |
| NotSupportedException | Argument represents a geometry of not supported type. |
| FormatException | Argument is not a valid Well-Known Binary. |

### Remarks

If there are extra bytes after the geometry a FormatException exception is thrown.
