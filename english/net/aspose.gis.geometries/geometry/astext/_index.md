## Geometry.AsText method (1 of 3)

Translates this geometry to its Well-Known Text representation.

```csharp
public string AsText()
```

### Return Value

Well-Known Text representation of this geometry.

### Remarks

Output of this method is in Iso WKT variant. The default numeric format is [`General`](../../../aspose.gis/numericformat/general) (with "0" precision).

### See Also

* class [Geometry](../../geometry)
* namespace [Aspose.Gis.Geometries](../../geometry)
* assembly [Aspose.GIS](../../../)

## Geometry.AsText method (2 of 3)

Translates this geometry to its Well-Known Text representation.

```csharp
public string AsText(WktVariant variant)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variant | WktVariant | Well-Known Text variant to use. |

### Return Value

Well-Known Text representation of this geometry.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| NotSupportedException | Geometry can not be represented in requested WKT variant. Currently this happens when [`HasCurveGeometry`](../hascurvegeometry) of geometry is `true` and WKT variant is SimpleFeatureAccessOutdated. |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *variant* is not a valid [`WktVariant`](../../wktvariant). |

### Remarks

The default numeric format is [`General`](../../../aspose.gis/numericformat/general) (with "0" precision).

### See Also

* enum [WktVariant](../../wktvariant)
* class [Geometry](../../geometry)
* namespace [Aspose.Gis.Geometries](../../geometry)

## Geometry.AsText method (3 of 3)

Translates this geometry to its Well-Known Text representation.

```csharp
public string AsText(WktVariant variant, NumericFormat format)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variant | WktVariant | Well-Known Text variant to use. |
| format | NumericFormat | Coordinate format for conversion to string. See the [`NumericFormat`](../../../aspose.gis/numericformat) to get it. |

### Return Value

Well-Known Text representation of this geometry.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| NotSupportedException | Geometry can not be represented in requested WKT variant. Currently this happens when [`HasCurveGeometry`](../hascurvegeometry) of geometry is `true` and WKT variant is SimpleFeatureAccessOutdated. |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *variant* is not a valid [`WktVariant`](../../wktvariant). |
