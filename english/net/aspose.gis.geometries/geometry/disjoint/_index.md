## Geometry.Disjoint method

Determines if this geometry is disjoint from a specified geometry.

```csharp
public bool Disjoint(IGeometry other)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | IGeometry | A geometry. |

### Return Value

`true` if this geometry is "spatially disjoint" from another geometry. `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | One of the geometries is invalid in such way that operation can not be finished. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../../igeometry/spatialreferencesystem) of geometries are not equivalent. You can use [`SpatialReferenceSystemTransformation`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystemtransformation) in order to convert geometries to the same spatial reference system. |

### Remarks

This method tests whether geometries are disjoint in terms of DE-9IM intersection matrix. Basically, it tests that two geometries have no common points. This method is equivalent to:

```csharp
this.Relate(other, "FF*FF****");
```

See OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for more details about DE-9IM.
