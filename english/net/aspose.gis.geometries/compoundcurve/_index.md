## CompoundCurve class

A curve that represents a sequence of contiguous curves such that adjacent curves are joined at their end points.

```csharp
public class CompoundCurve : Curve, ICompoundCurve
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CompoundCurve](compoundcurve/#constructor)() | Initializes a new instance of the `CompoundCurve` class. |
| [CompoundCurve](compoundcurve/#constructor_1)(ICompoundCurve) | Initializes a new instance of the `CompoundCurve` class. |
| [CompoundCurve](compoundcurve/#constructor_2)(IEnumerable&lt;ICurve&gt;) | Initializes a new instance of the `CompoundCurve` class. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |

| [Dimension](../../aspose.gis.geometries/curve/dimension/) { get; } | Gets the topological dimension of this [`Geometry`](../geometry/). |
| override [EndPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/compoundcurve/endpoint/) { get; } | Returns a copy of the end point of the curve. |
| override [GeometryType](../../aspose.gis.geometries/compoundcurve/geometrytype/) { get; } | Gets the type of the geometry. |
| override [HasCurveGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/compoundcurve/hascurvegeometry/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this geometry is or contains curve (not linear) geometry. |

This property can be `null`, if SpatialReferenceSystem is unset. Assigning new SpatialReferenceSystem will not perform any coordinate transformation, only reference will change. |
| override [StartPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/compoundcurve/startpoint/) { get; } | Returns a copy of the starting point of the curve. |
