## Surface class

A [`Surface`](../surface) is a two-dimensional geometric object.

```csharp
public abstract class Surface : Geometry, ISurface
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Dimension](dimension) { get; } | Gets the topological dimension of this [`Geometry`](../geometry). |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract [GetPointOnSurface](getpointonsurface)() | Finds a point that is guaranteed to be on this surface. |
| [ToEditable](toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
