## GeometryCollection.ToLinearGeometry method (1 of 2)

Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`.

```csharp
public IGeometryCollection ToLinearGeometry()
```

### Return Value

A geometry, that has no curve geometries. This is the equivalent of [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../igeometrycollection/tolineargeometry) with default `tolerance`. Default `tolerance`s value is dependent on [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystem) of this geometry:  For projected SRS Tolerance is 0.001 meters (in SRS units)  For geographic SRS Tolerance is `1e-5` degrees (in SRS units)  For unknown SRS Tolerance is `1e-5` For more details on what transformations are applied refer to [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../igeometrycollection/tolineargeometry) specification.

### Exceptions

| InvalidOperationException | This geometry is invalid in a such way, that operation can not be completed. |

## GeometryCollection.ToLinearGeometry method (2 of 2)

Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`.

```csharp
public IGeometryCollection ToLinearGeometry(double tolerance)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tolerance | Double | The `tolerance` to use. The result is guaranteed to be less than `tolerance` away from the curved geometry. |

### Return Value

A geometry, that has no curve geometries. The following transformations are applied: CircularStrings are linearized (transformed into LineStrings with specified *tolerance*) CompoundCurves are joined into `LineString`s CurvePolygons are transformed into Polygons MultiCurves are transformed into MultiCurves MultiSurfaces are transformed into MultiPolygons  As a result, [`HasCurveGeometry`](../../igeometry/hascurvegeometry) of output geometry is `false`.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | `tolerance` is less than or equal to `0`. |
| InvalidOperationException | This geometry is invalid in a such way, that operation can not be completed. |
