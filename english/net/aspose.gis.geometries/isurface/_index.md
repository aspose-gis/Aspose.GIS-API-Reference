## ISurface interface

A [`ISurface`](../isurface) is a two-dimensional geometric object.

```csharp
public interface ISurface : IGeometry
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetPointOnSurface](../../aspose.gis.geometries/isurface/getpointonsurface)() | Finds a point that is guaranteed to be on this surface. |
| [ToEditable](../../aspose.gis.geometries/isurface/toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/isurface/tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/isurface/tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
