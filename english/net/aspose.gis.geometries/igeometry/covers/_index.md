## IGeometry.Covers method

Determines whether this geometry covers a specified geometry.

```csharp
public bool Covers(IGeometry other)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | IGeometry | A geometry. |

### Return Value

`true` if this geometry is "spatially covers" another geometry. `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | One of the geometries is invalid in such way that operation can not be finished. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of geometries are not equivalent. You can use [`SpatialReferenceSystemTransformation`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystemtransformation) in order to convert geometries to the same spatial reference system. |

### Remarks

This method tests whether one geometry covers another in terms of DE-9IM intersection matrix. One geometry covers another one, if the geometry contains every point of another geometry. This method is similar to [`SpatiallyContains`](../spatiallycontains), but returns `true` more often, since it does not distinguish between interior and boundary points. So, if geometry A lies on boundary of geometry B, [`SpatiallyContains`](../spatiallycontains) returns `false`, while this method returns `true`. This method is equivalent to:

```csharp
this.Relate(other, "T*****FF*") || this.Relate(other, "*T****FF*") || this.Relate(other, "***T**FF*) || this.Relate(other, "***T*FF*");
```
