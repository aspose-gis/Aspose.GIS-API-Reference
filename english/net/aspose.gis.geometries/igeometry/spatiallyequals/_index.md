## IGeometry.SpatiallyEquals method

Determines if this geometry spatially equal to a specified geometry.

```csharp
public bool SpatiallyEquals(IGeometry other)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | IGeometry | A geometry. |

## Return Value

`true` if this geometry "spatially equals" to specified geometry. `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | One of the geometries is invalid in such way that operation can not be finished. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of geometries are not equivalent. You can use [`SpatialReferenceSystemTransformation`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystemtransformation) in order to convert geometries to the same spatial reference system. |

### Remarks

This method tests equality in terms of DE-9IM intersection matrix. It does not depend on order of components (e.g. order of interior rings in polygon), Z and M values. Basically, it tests that two geometries occupy the same "space" when projected on two dimensional space. This method is equivalent to:

```csharp
this.Relate(other, "T*F**FFF*");
```

See OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for more details about DE-9IM.
