## IGeometry.Within method (1 of 2)

Determines whether this geometry is within a specified extent.

```csharp
public bool Within(Extent extent)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| extent | Extent | The extent. |

## Return Value

`true` if this geometry is within extent; `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |

## IGeometry.Within method (2 of 2)

Determines whether this geometry is within a specified geometry.

```csharp
public bool Within(IGeometry other)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | IGeometry | A geometry. |

## Return Value

`true` if this geometry is "spatially within" another geometry. `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | One of the geometries is invalid in such way that operation can not be finished. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of geometries are not equivalent. You can use [`SpatialReferenceSystemTransformation`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystemtransformation) in order to convert geometries to the same spatial reference system. |

### Remarks

This method tests whether one geometry is within another in terms of DE-9IM intersection matrix. One geometry is within another one, if another geometry contains every point of the geometry and geometries interiors intersect. This method is equivalent to:

```csharp
this.Relate(other, "T*F**F***");
```

See OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for more details about DE-9IM and "spatially within" relation.
