## IGeometry.AsBinary method (1 of 2)

Translates this geometry to its Well-Known Binary representation.

```csharp
public byte[] AsBinary()
```

## Return Value

Well-Known Binary representation of this geometry.

### Remarks

Output of this method is in Iso WKB variant.

## IGeometry.AsBinary method (2 of 2)

Translates this geometry to its Well-Known Binary representation.

```csharp
public byte[] AsBinary(WkbVariant variant)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| variant | WkbVariant | Well-Known Binary variant to use. |

## Return Value

Well-Known Binary representation of this geometry.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| NotSupportedException | Geometry can not be represented in requested WKB variant. Currently this happens when [`HasCurveGeometry`](../hascurvegeometry) of geometry is `true` and WKB variant is SimpleFeatureAccessOutdated. |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | *variant* is not a valid [`WkbVariant`](../../wkbvariant). |
