## IGeometry.Touches method

Determines if this geometry and a specified geometry touch.

```csharp
public bool Touches(IGeometry other)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| other | IGeometry | A geometry. |

### Return Value

`true` if this geometry is "spatially touches" another geometry. `false` otherwise.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentNullException | Argument is `null`. |
| ArgumentException | One of the geometries is invalid in such way that operation can not be finished. |
| ArgumentException | [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../spatialreferencesystem) of geometries are not equivalent. You can use [`SpatialReferenceSystemTransformation`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystemtransformation) in order to convert geometries to the same spatial reference system. |

### Remarks

This method tests whether geometries touch each other in terms of DE-9IM intersection matrix. Two geometries touch each other if they have at least one boundary point in common, but no interior points. That is: two [`LineString`](../../linestring)s touch each other if they share an endpoint, but don't share a segment, two polygons touch each other if they share part of exterior or interior ring, but their interiors don't overlap. This method is equivalent to:

```csharp
this.Relate(other, "FT*******") || this.Relate(other, "F**T*****") || this.Relate(other, "F***T****");
```

See OpenGIS Simple Features Specification for more details about DE-9IM and "spatially touches" relation.
