## MultiCurve.ToLinearGeometry method (1 of 2)

Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`.

```csharp
public IMultiLineString ToLinearGeometry(double tolerance)
```

| Parameter | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| tolerance | Double | The `tolerance` to use. The result is guaranteed to be less than `tolerance` away from the curved geometry, unless the number of points needed to linearize the geometry exceeds the per-quadrant maximum, currently equal to 10000 points. |

## Return Value

A [`IMultiLineString`](../../imultilinestring) that approximates or equivalent to this [`IMultiCurve`](../../imulticurve):  If this object is [`IMultiLineString`](../../imultilinestring) itself the result is equivalent to this object If this object is not [`IMultiLineString`](../../imultilinestring) - all curves are linearized and new `IMultiLineString` is created

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentOutOfRangeException | `tolerance` is less than or equal to `0`. |
| InvalidOperationException | This geometry is invalid in a such way, that operation can not be completed. |

## MultiCurve.ToLinearGeometry method (2 of 2)

Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`.

```csharp
public IMultiLineString ToLinearGeometry()
```

## Return Value

A [`IMultiLineString`](../../imultilinestring) that approximates or equivalent to this [`IMultiCurve`](../../imulticurve). This is the equivalent of [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../imulticurve/tolineargeometry) with default `tolerance`. Default `tolerance`s value is dependent on [`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../../../aspose.gis.spatialreferencing/spatialreferencesystem) of this geometry:  For projected SRS Tolerance is 0.001 meters (in SRS units)  For geographic SRS Tolerance is `1e-5` degrees (in SRS units)  For unknown SRS Tolerance is `1e-5` For more details on what transformations are applied refer to [`ToLinearGeometry`](../../imulticurve/tolineargeometry) specification.

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| InvalidOperationException | This geometry is invalid in a such way, that operation can not be completed. |
