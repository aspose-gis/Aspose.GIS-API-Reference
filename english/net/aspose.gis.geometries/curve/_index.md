## Curve class

A [`Curve`](../curve) is a sequence of points.

```csharp
public abstract class Curve : Geometry, ICurve
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Dimension](dimension) { get; } | Gets the topological dimension of this [`Geometry`](../geometry). |
| abstract [EndPoint](endpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the end point of the curve. |
| [IsClosed](isclosed) { get; } | Gets a values indicating whether a curve is closed. A curve is closed if its start point is equal to its end point. |
| abstract [StartPoint](startpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the starting point of the curve. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| abstract [Reverse](reverse)() | Reverses this curve. |
| [ToEditable](toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
