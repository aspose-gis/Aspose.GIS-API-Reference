## Curve class

A `Curve` is a sequence of points.

```csharp
public abstract class Curve : Geometry, ICurve
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [CoordinateDimension](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/coordinatedimension/) { get; } | Gets the number of coordinate dimensions for this [`Geometry`](../geometry/). |
| [Dimension](../../aspose.gis.geometries/curve/dimension/) { get; } | Gets the topological dimension of this [`Geometry`](../geometry/). |
| abstract [EndPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/curve/endpoint/) { get; } | Returns a copy of the end point of the curve. |
| abstract [GeometryType](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/geometrytype/) { get; } | Gets the type of the geometry. |
| virtual [HasCurveGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/hascurvegeometry/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this geometry is or contains curve (not linear) geometry. |
| virtual [HasM](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/hasm/) { get; set; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance has M coordinate. |
| virtual [HasZ](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/hasz/) { get; set; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance has Z coordinate. |
| [IsClosed](../../aspose.gis.geometries/curve/isclosed/) { get; } | Gets a values indicating whether a curve is closed. A curve is closed if its start point is equal to its end point. |
| virtual [IsEmpty](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/isempty/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is empty. |
| [IsSimple](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/issimple/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is simple from SFA point of view. |
| [IsValid](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/isvalid/) { get; } | Gets a value indicating whether this instance is valid. |
| abstract [SpatialReferenceSystem](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/spatialreferencesystem/) { get; set; } | Gets SpatialReferenceSystem of this instance. This property can be `null`, is SpatialReferenceSystem is unknown. Assigning new SpatialReferenceSystem will not perform any coordinate transformation, only reference will change. |
| abstract [StartPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/curve/startpoint/) { get; } | Returns a copy of the starting point of the curve. |
