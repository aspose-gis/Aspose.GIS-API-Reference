public interface ICurve : IGeometry
```

| [EndPoint](endpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the end point of the curve. |
| [IsClosed](isclosed) { get; } | Gets a values indicating whether a curve is closed. A curve is closed if its start point is equal to its end point. |
| [StartPoint](startpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the starting point of the curve. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ToEditable](toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
