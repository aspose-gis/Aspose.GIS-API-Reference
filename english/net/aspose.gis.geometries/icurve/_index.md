## ICurve interface

A [`ICurve`](../icurve) is a sequence of points.

```csharp
public interface ICurve : IGeometry
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [EndPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/endpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the end point of the curve. |
| [IsClosed](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/isclosed) { get; } | Gets a values indicating whether a curve is closed. A curve is closed if its start point is equal to its end point. |
| [StartPoint](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/startpoint) { get; } | Returns a copy of the starting point of the curve. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [ToEditable](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](../../aspose.gis.geometries/icurve/tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
