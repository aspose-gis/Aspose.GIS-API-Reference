## IGeometryCollection interface

A [`IGeometryCollection`](../igeometrycollection) is a [`IGeometry`](../igeometry) that is a collection of one or more geometries.

```csharp
public interface IGeometryCollection : IEnumerable<IGeometry>, IEquatable<IGeometryCollection>, 
    IGeometry
```

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Count](count) { get; } | Gets the number of geometries in this collection. |
| [Item](item) { get; } | Gets a [`IGeometry`](../igeometry) at the specified index. |

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [GetPointOnSurface](getpointonsurface)() | Finds a point that is guaranteed to be on one of the surfaces in this collection. |
| [ReplacePolygonsByLines](replacepolygonsbylines)() | Gets polygons represented as lines of this geometry. |
| [ToEditable](toeditable)() | Gets an editable copy of this geometry. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)() | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the default `tolerance`. |
| [ToLinearGeometry](tolineargeometry)(double) | Gets approximate or equivalent non-curve version of this geometry using the specified `tolerance`. |
