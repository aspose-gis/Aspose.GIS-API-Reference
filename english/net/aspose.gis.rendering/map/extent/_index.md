## Map.Extent property

Specifies bounds of map to render. If set to `null`, extent is calculated during rendering to include all geometries in all layers.

```csharp
public Extent Extent { get; set; }
```

### Exceptions

| exception | condition |
| --- | --- |
| ArgumentException | [`IsValid`](../../../aspose.gis/extent/isvalid) is `false`.[`Width`](../../../aspose.gis/extent/width) is less or equal to zero.[`Height`](../../../aspose.gis/extent/height) is less or equal to zero.[`SpatialReferenceSystem`](../../../aspose.gis/extent/spatialreferencesystem) is `null`. |

### Remarks

If spatial reference system of the extent is not equal to spatial reference system of the map, extent is being transformed to the target spatial reference system during rendering.
