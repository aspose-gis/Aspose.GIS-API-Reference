```csharp
public struct Measurement
```

## Constructors

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [Measurement](measurement/)(double, Unit) | Creates new instance. |

## Properties

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [Zero](../../aspose.gis.rendering/measurement/zero/) { get; } | A measurement of zero length. |
| [Unit](../../aspose.gis.rendering/measurement/unit/) { get; } | A unit of measurement. |
| [Value](../../aspose.gis.rendering/measurement/value/) { get; } | A number that indicates the length of the measurement. |
