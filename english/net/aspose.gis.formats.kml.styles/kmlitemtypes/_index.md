## KmlItemTypes enumeration

Specifies how a kml:Feature and its contents shall be displayed as items in a list view.

```csharp
public enum KmlItemTypes
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| RadioFolder | `0` | Only one of items shall be visible at a time. |
| Check | `1` | The visibility is tied to its item's checkbox |
| CheckHideChildren | `2` | Use a normal checkbox for visibility but do not display the item's children in the list view. |
| CheckOffOnly | `3` | Prevents all items from being made visible at once—that is, the user can turn everything in the Container Group off but cannot turn everything on at the same time. |
