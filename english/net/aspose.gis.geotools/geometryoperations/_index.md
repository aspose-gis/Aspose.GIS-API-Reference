## GeometryOperations class

The geometry operations class provides additional geoprocessing algorithms for geometries.

```csharp
public static class GeometryOperations
```

## Methods

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| static [CloseLinearRing](../../aspose.gis.geotools/geometryoperations/closelinearring/)(IGeometry) | Closes geometric segments in rings if it needs. |
| static [CreateMidpoints](../../aspose.gis.geotools/geometryoperations/createmidpoints/)(IGeometry) | Create midpoints by adding a new point in the middle to each segment. |
| static [DeleteNearPoints](../../aspose.gis.geotools/geometryoperations/deletenearpoints/)(IGeometry, NearPointsCleanerOptions) | Delete points that are too close to each other. |
| static [OrderGeometryCollection](../../aspose.gis.geotools/geometryoperations/ordergeometrycollection/)(IGeometry) | Order geometry collection by type to four collection (point, line, polygon and other type) |
| static [SimplifySegments](../../aspose.gis.geotools/geometryoperations/simplifysegments/)(IGeometry, SimplifySegmentsOptions) | Delete points lying on the same segment. |

## Remarks

Other algorithms you can find in the methods of [`Geometry`](../../aspose.gis.geometries/geometry/)
