## GeoJsonOptions.WriteBoundingBoxes property

Determines if GeoJSON objects should be included information on the coordinate range for its Geometries. If set to `true`, a member "bbox" is generated for each geometry (not null) when it's added to the layer. Default value is `false`.

```csharp
public bool WriteBoundingBoxes { get; set; }
```

## Remarks

This is a creation option - it does not affect opening.
