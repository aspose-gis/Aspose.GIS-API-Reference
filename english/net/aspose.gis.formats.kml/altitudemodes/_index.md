## AltitudeModes enumeration

Altitude mode for KML geometries.

```csharp
public enum AltitudeModes
```

### Values

| Name | Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| None | `0` | Without altitude mode. |
| RelativeToGround | `1` | Interprets the altitude as a value in meters above the ground. |
| ClampToGround | `2` | For a camera, this setting also places the camera relativeToGround, since putting the camera exactly at terrain height would mean that the eye would intersect the terrain (and the view would be blocked). |
| Absolute | `3` | Interprets the altitude as a value in meters above sea level. |
